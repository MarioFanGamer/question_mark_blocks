# Question Mark Blocks

A set of custom blocks which recreate the question mark blocks from SMW, to be used with Gopher Popcorn Stew.

This readme is primarily on a technical side and explains on how to use this Git repository as well as how to program on the blocks. For the user manual, please look up the file `Question Mark Blocks - Readme.txt`.

TODO: Write a more detailed readme.
